                        The website displays 79 synagogues in New York City that have been repurposed, such as being converted into other religious places of worship, private residences, businesses, restaurants, education, art, and governmental buildings. 
                        The synagogues are shown on a map, and visitors can click on each one to see more information about its origins and the current occupants (as of 2013). 
                        The website's purpose is to document the adaptive reuse of these historical buildings and analyze historical trends, as well as provide a resource for those interested in the Jewish history of New York City. 
                        This website was developed as my final project in the course Jews of New York, taught by Professor Sandra Fox at New York University.

                        The data provided on the website is sourced from Ellen Levitt's book, The Lost Synagogues of Manhattan. This book documents the architectural and cultural history of synagogues in Manhattan, and provides detailed information about each building, including its original purpose and how it has been repurposed (as of 2013). We are grateful to Ellen Levitt for her extensive research and for sharing her knowledge with us. Link to her book can be found here:
